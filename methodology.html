                <p><strong>Why use digital history?</strong></p>
<p> The goal of this project is to utilize components of the digital world to enhance the understanding of Catherine of Siena&rsquo;s created network system. A digital history project is a more suitable way to fully decipher Catherine&rsquo;s complex network system because it enables viewers to visualize a network of people with connections to Saint Catherine of Siena that a traditional thesis cannot depict. It also allows for a new and exciting way to analyze data and to showcase that data in visual and textual ways. An interactive visual way to analyze data creates a space that can catch deeper relationships and connections that traditional ways essays may not. Using specific network tools, this captured moment presents a vivid image that explains the power dynamics and social structure Catherine surrounded herself with during her successful saintly career. Additionally, a digital history project promotes accessibility to a wider public audience that a traditional thesis would not reach. Digital history is the path forward for academics because it blends traditional academic (ideals) along with the goal of reaching the public about what historians do for understanding the past. Digital history is a relevant cause in the Age of Technology and academic historians such as myself are broadening scholarly work to include the digital realm. Using digital history allows for outside researchers to make comparisons and conclusions with the same evidence upfront, rather than tucked away in an archive. It diminishes the line between the general public and the sometimes private work that historians accomplish. The graphs and tools I use are available for everyone to see. An example of this method is Steven Bednarski&rsquo;s <em>A Poisoned Past: The Life and Times of Margarida de Portu, a Fourteenth-century Accused Prisoner.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
</em></p>
<p> By showcasing the process of creating a final argument, others can take different approaches all while understanding my path. It also allows me to showcase my decisions with the data visible. It also provides an interactive component that engages with viewers and allows them to pursue the information in their own way rather than the specific organization that a paper has. Digital history provides a space for viewers to self-educate themselves in a manner that makes sense to them. Innovating and interactive ideas encourage viewership and makes digital history a prime medium for information to be passed along. </p>
<p> I use digital history as the tool to display my findings because of the wider audience, the visual component, and the ability to have an interactive data set. Additionally, digital technology is providing new ways to learn material, and as a creator it is providing new ways to analyze and discover information. My goal is two-fold, I expand on the use of network analysis and I present it in a new age way that has uses in multiple settings. </p>
          <p><strong>Interactive History</strong></p>
<p>My choice to use an interactive interface rather than static web pages came from the idea that viewers are more engaged in information that they can play with. Additionally, to fully understand Catherine&rsquo;s network it is important to play with the different &lsquo;characters&rsquo; involved in her life and how they interact with each other. Having the ability to visually see the evidence is a new way to understand the past, and personally is much easier to view and come to new conclusions. </p>
<p>It is also a way for viewers and other scholars to download my data and come to their own conclusions, which furthers the historical knowledge on Catherine and her life. Viewers can pursue the information in their own way that makes the most sense to their learning styles. This is where typically theseses can loose an audience, by organization that is lacking in competency. </p>
<p><strong>Why use networks?</strong></p>
<p> Using network analysis on a 14th-century saint is a new way to formulate Catherine&rsquo;s life that is inclusive of all those around her that helped her popularity rise. Network analysis creates a new picture of the social structure that followed her on travels and is missed by scholars today because studies do not typically include the wider network surrounding her.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p> These connections are easily missed because of the primary focus on Catherine alone and understanding her as a solitary unit, but my work of her network analyzes her relationships with travel companions and beyond. Network studies understand that not all actors involved are aware of the network surrounding them, but they are still crucial to the success or failure of that network. Network analysis is rising in popularity among historians, Claire Lemercier argues that network analysis solves some historical issues because it takes, &ldquo;reality as relational thus helps to go beyond purely micro or macro, agency-based or structure-based visions of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The use of network analysis on Catherine&rsquo;s life works well because of the network she purposefully made. Letters are an age old way to create a network system and Catherine fully utilized this system. She maintained communication with many of her recipients and wrote to an array of people from a multitude of classes, occupations, and genders. It provides a far-reaching network across city-states. Providing this information digitally creates a stronger argument because the connections are visibly seen when using interactive graphs. Catherine had three levels of networks, her close companion group, the non-traveling group, and the wider range of letter recipients. The interactive graphs showcase the strongest connections Catherine had.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> </p>
<p>Highlight certain aspects of Catherine network</p>
<p><strong>What tools do I use?</strong></p>
<p> Gephi (Gephi.com) is a tool for creating a visual network system that can handle multiple variables. I chose Gephi because it is a system that allows for customization for individual projects and it suited my needs. Jigsaw is another system that works well for network analysis but I chose to use Gephi. Other common network systems work better with modern social media networks and do not relate back to historical documents like Gephi and Jigsaw do. Using networks with historical documents is a new trend, therefore not all network tools accommodate the variables of historical documents such as date, location, contextual information about the time period and historical persons. </p>
<p>I used many &lsquo;How To Guides&rsquo; online that assited in this process: </p>
<p>For Gephi</p>
<p><strong>My Data </strong></p>
<p>My dataset came from three main secondary sources that are heavily enriched with primary sources that I did not have the resources to access myself.</p>
<p> From these sources, I extrapolated the connections they discovered and some hidden beneath the surface that I detected. I also looked into primary sources of Catherine, her letters, hagiography, <em>Prosseco SOMETHING, </em>to track relationships that my secondary sources may have missed. Rather than creating my own .cvs file outside of Gephi, I chose to create my data within the program. I did this because I found it easier to manage and see the connections as I went giving me a better sense of change over time. It also allowed me to play with the settings while composing my networks that allowed me to see different variations of her networks. </p>
<p>I initially intended to use Catherine&rsquo;s 380 letters as the basis of my visualization, however that would not show the complexity of who was influential in her network, only that she wrote to groups and individuals. This pushed me away from using only primary sources as my database and forced the inclusion of secondary sources. This is a pitfall to my research because I do not have access to the primary sources I claim to use. However, because my project&rsquo;s main goal is to consolidate several scholars work to create new questions about Catherine&rsquo;s life, it is crucial to understand how other scholars understand Catherine. I still used Catheirne&rsquo;s letters to understand the relationships between Catherine&rsquo;s companions, as they are discussed in her letters. This primary source analysis is the true undertone to my project, understanding the relationships between her male and female companions, the relationships those involved in various governments had with each other, and how Catherine&rsquo;s specific choosing of her companions impacted her success as a female saint in 14th-century Italy.</p>
