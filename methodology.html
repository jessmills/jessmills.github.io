                <p><strong>Why use digital history?</strong></p>
<p> The goal of this project is to utilize components of the digital world to enhance the understanding of Catherine of Siena&rsquo;s created network system. A digital history project is a more suitable way to fully decipher Catherine&rsquo;s complex network system because it enables viewers to visualize a network of people with connections to Saint Catherine of Siena that a traditional thesis cannot depict. It also allows for a new and exciting way to analyze data and to showcase that data in visual and textual ways. An interactive visual way to analyze data creates a space that can catch deeper relationships and connections that traditional ways essays may not. Using specific network tools, this captured moment presents a vivid image that explains the power dynamics and social structure Catherine surrounded herself with during her successful saintly career. Additionally, a digital history project promotes accessibility to a wider public audience that a traditional thesis would not reach. Digital history is the path forward for academics because it blends traditional academic (ideals) along with the goal of reaching the public about what historians do for understanding the past. Digital history is a relevant cause in the Age of Technology and academic historians such as myself are broadening scholarly work to include the digital realm. Using digital history allows for outside researchers to make comparisons and conclusions with the same evidence upfront, rather than tucked away in an archive. It diminishes the line between the general public and the sometimes private work that historians accomplish. The graphs and tools I use are available for everyone to see. An example of this method is Steven Bednarski&rsquo;s <em>A Poisoned Past: The Life and Times of Margarida de Portu, a Fourteenth-century Accused Prisoner.</em></p>
<p> By showcasing the process of creating a final argument, others can take different approaches all while understanding my path. It also allows me to showcase my decisions with the data visible. It also provides an interactive component that engages with viewers and allows them to pursue the information in their own way rather than the specific organization that a paper has. Digital history provides a space for viewers to self-educate themselves in a manner that makes sense to them. Innovating and interactive ideas encourage viewership and makes digital history a prime medium for information to be passed along. </p>
<p> I use digital history as the tool to display my findings because of the wider audience, the visual component, and the ability to have an interactive data set. Additionally, digital technology is providing new ways to learn material, and as a creator it is providing new ways to analyze and discover information. My goal is two-fold, I expand on the use of network analysis and I present it in a new age way that has uses in multiple settings. </p>
