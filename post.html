                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Essay</h2>
                    
                    <p> My essay argues for the importance of re-evaluating Catherine's relationships with her network. 
                        I analyze Catherine's relationship with key individuals such as: Frate Tommaso dalla Fonte, William 
                        of Flete, Nanni di ser Vanni, the Salimbeni Family, and most importantly Raymond of Capua.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">General Observations from Gephi Graph</h2>
                    
                    <p>Within the network are ‘groups’ of individuals that all center around a town. Naturally, all the
                        Florentines are connected to the Florentines and the Sienese know the Sienese, but interestingly, 
                        these groups do not connect with each other. They remain separated, with limited connections to each
                        other. Evidence after Catherine’s death suggests that these groups never integrated completely as 
                        the men do not interact with one another.</p> 
                    
                    <p> The main male followers are all connected to either a noble family or government structure. As 
                        Thomas Luongo points out, many of Catherine’s followers are connected politically, but he did not 
                        include the minor characters in her life. Almost every single person in her network is connected to 
                        a political entity or noble family. This furthers the notion that Catherine had serious connections
                        to help her succeed in the political world that then transcends to help cannonize her after death.</p>
                    
                    <p> Raymond is not well connected to Catherine’s world but rather a difference political world (not viewed
                        on my chart).The most interesting observation resulting in my visualization is the lack of connections
                        Raymond of Capua had within the network. Catherine’s history is accredited to Raymond because he wrote
                        her hagiography and is credited as the man who made Catherine’s career. He was well connected within 
                        the Dominican world, but in relation to Catherine’s world, he is alone. It begs the question of how 
                        important Raymond was to Catherine while she was alive? Without a question, he was crucial in her
                        post-mortem life and legacy, writing her life and advocating for her canonization, but during her 
                        life, did he only provide spiritual authority.</p>
                    
                    <p> Her Dominican followers are not well connected, they were used more as a spiritual support.Catherine 
                        created a spiritual support group in Siena before 1374, the year historians argue, “she went public”. 
                        Her Dominican followers are not politically connected, which suggests that in the very beginning 
                        Catherine may not have intended to become a political powerhouse.</p>
                    
                    <p> Pope Gregory XI’s node quite small. Pope Gregory is key due to his legacy of returning the papacy to
                        Rome, heeding Catherine’s advice. However, in relation to Catherine’s created network, he does not 
                        have many connections. This is due to different political worlds, but interesting that he had no 
                        connections to any of her Florentine companions because of the numerous interdicts and the rebellions
                        of Florence during this time.</p>
                    
                    <p> Catherine’s mother, Monna Lapa, is a much larger node than I was anticipating. However, I do not think 
                        it is due to any significant political sway she may have had. Monna Lapa is connected to numerous 
                        family members and the <i>Mantellate</i> women of Siena, producing a large number of connections for
                        her.</p>
                    
                    <p>Before creating this network, I always assumed Tommaso dalla Fonte was simply a cousin and confessor 
                        to Catherine.
                        However, he is connected to the Dodici, the leading government in Siena before 1372, which implies 
                        that the political influence on Catherine may have started much earlier than historians typically 
                        assert. Not only is he biological family to Catherine, but he was her first confessor, which implies 
                        that her early spiritual journey could have been molded by Tommaso in more ways than history presents.
                        His involvement with the government may also have seeped into her spiritual upbringing. See my article
                        for a deeper analysis of this connection.
